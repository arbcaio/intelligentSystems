# Getting Started
This section guides you on how to run the exercises from the Intelligent Systems course. 
There are two main ways to run the exercises: using the p5.js Web Editor or locally with Visual Studio Code.

## Method 1: Using p5.js Web Editor
- Open the p5.js Web Editor.
- Copy the code of the exercise you want to see.

- Run the code to see it in action.

## Method 2: Using Visual Studio Code
